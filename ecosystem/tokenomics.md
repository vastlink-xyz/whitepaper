### **How $VAST works:**

* $VAST will be powering Vastlink's open marketplace where vendors sell their products and services for users to purchase (similar to Apple's AppStore). Vastlink gets 20% from sales.
* The founding members, team members, and contributors all work to earn $VAST, investors invest to get $VAST.
* Vastlink has 1:1 token and share scheme, which means if you hold 1 $VAST then you hold 1 share of Vastlink.
* $VAST is also for community governance, such as voting.
* Users can invest $VAST into products and services, this way vendors can get financial support to build, and then share revenue with the users who invest.
* Vastlink sets up liquidity pools on DEX for $VAST token holders to cash out.
* Vastlink puts all the vesting and cliff rules into the smart contract, so that they apply to everyone fairly and transparently.
