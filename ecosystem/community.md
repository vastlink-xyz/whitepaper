# Community

💡 Community members could use their $VAST tokens to propose and vote new features / products / services they want to have.

👷 Builders can then build and sell features / products / services in the marketplace to earn $VAST tokens.

🏛 Vastlink takes 20% cut off sales, like Apple AppStore, but revenue would be shared within the community via $VAST tokens.
