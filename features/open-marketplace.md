# Open Marketplace

#### 1. What is Marketplace?

Marketplace on Vastlink, is like AppStore on iPhone, it is where:

* Users find and get the products they want.
* Developers/vendors build and sell their products and services to earn.
* Vastlink only takes 20% from all sales, and share value within the ecosystem via tokenomics.
